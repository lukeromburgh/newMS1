CSS Scale property does exist, which is why it works. The W3 CSS validator has not been updated to accept it but scale is a transform property in official CSS documentation.

<h2>Target User</h2>
<pre>
The popular Reddit community r/johnmayer has over 65,000 members and is ranked in the top 2% of all 
  Reddit communities by size. The members of this group are hard-core Mayer fans and follow both on 
  and off the stage. A single hub on the internet where these fans could find unreleased music, 
  YouTube videos, and tab sheets to learn his songs on guitar would be extremely popular. I plan to 
  work on the site more to the point that I am happy to launch it as a live site and promote it on the subreddit.

Above are real-life scenarios of people looking for tab sheets and song recordings that would be on my 
  site. As a member of the subreddit myself, I know first-hand just how many people ask these sorts of 
  questions on a daily basis, and how many people would benefit from and enjoy a site like MayerArchives.

These wireframes provide a basic structure for the website, focusing on usability and easy navigation. The design can be further refined with additional details and styling.

<h2>Colour Scheme</h2>

The colour scheme of the website was styled around John Mayer's most recent album cover. 

![image](https://github.com/lukeromburgh/jm_archives/assets/173364172/3cb80a44-b194-42f1-85be-529e1f82bdcc)

Utilizing the vintage aesthetic I chose to go with a beige off-white as the background colour, and then pastel blues and pinks as the accent colours.

<pre>
background:       #FFFAEC
nav and footer:   #111111
accent 1:         #FFABD2
accent 2:         #ABD8FF
accent 3:         #7EDAD6
</pre>


<h2>Typography</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I used the font <str>Poppins</str> for all website copy. Poppins bold was used for headings, and a mix of regular and semibold for the rest of the text.</li>
  <li>I embedded the font using Google Fonts.</li>
</ul>

    <td>I am unsure as to why I am getting this error, my research has shown that the scale property does in fact exist and I am yet to find an alternative that is as simple to use. Therefore this issue will remain unfixed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h2>Browser Support</h2>
I have tested the website on Safari, Chrome, Arc, and Opera to check for compatibility issues.
The website works correctly on all the browsers I tested.

<h2>Accessibilty</h2>
I used WAVE to double-check my accessibility ratings, thankfully I did this because I had missed some alt elements on a few images. (I went back and fixed this)
